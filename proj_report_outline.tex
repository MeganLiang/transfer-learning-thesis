\begin{abstract}

The project will explore Artificial Intelligence applied to data mining with the use of LCSs to extract information from the huge amounts of data being collected every day. Drawbacks of LCS include being easily overwhelmed with too much data and being unable to extract information from low-level features. Therefore, feature selection and feature construction techniques will be used in conjunction with the LCS. The first half of the project evaluated that features extracted from a CNN can be reused as abstract features in a LCS. The second half of the project will validate whether LCS can apply learnt knowledge onto similar but unseen domains.
